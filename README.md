Project Description: 
Our idea is to create a Simon Says game that uses one led as a "simon says" led, with it being on if simon says and off if simon doesn't say. At the same time, one of three leds will light up at the same time. If the simon led is on simultaneously, then you hold a corresponding button to score a point. If the simon led is off, then you make no inputs to any button to score a point. If the command is not followed, then the leds blink twice and the game enters an idle state which can be exited by holding the blue led. The score will be output on a website that has a refresh button for the database.
