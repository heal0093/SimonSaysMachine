Project Description: 
Our idea is to create a Simon Says game that flashes lights onto the buttons in a certain pattern. As the game goes on the user has to keep repeating the pattern and it gets progressively harder as it goes on. The game will update a leaderboard on a web page, and send the user an email to tell them their score.
